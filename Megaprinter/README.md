Hangprinter ![Hangprinter logo](https://vitana.se/opr3d/tbear/bilder/logo_blue_50.png)
===========

This is for a portable hangprinter tailored for exhibitions in large spaces.
Uses NEMA 23 stepper motors because of larger parts/higher inertia. Beefier motors helps avoid skipped steps w/ open loop control.
Designed in Fusion 360 because I'm not very good at openscad, but later things will be uploaded in openscad when things become more final.

Bill of Materials - Sorry, using hardware standard to US in early versions because they are easier for me to source. Metric to come!
